		<h5>Target Audience:</h5>
		<p>The target audience is people familiar with the Minecraft modding environment, especially 1.12.2 modding. Ideally people interested in expert-lite quest-based skyblock modpacks.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><b>Design Goals:</b><br>
		I would like the design of the site to be professional-looking but simple, with the goal of the site just being to provide information.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><b>Limiting Factors:</b><br>
		I will most likely be limited by what is taught in this class and what I have time to do. I want to include a lot of written content for the site, which isn't exactly needed to fulfill requirements in this class, so it is a bit of a time sink for little reason.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><b>Development Schedule:</b><br></p>
		<ul>
			<li>Week 1:</li>
			<li>Week 2: Website outline</li>
			<li>Week 3: Navigation</li>
			<li>Week 4: Text styling</li>
			<li>Week 5: Images, colors</li>
			<li>Weel 6: Basic text descriptions</li>
			<li>Week 7: More text description detail and CSS development</li>
			<li>Remaining weeks are unknown, likely making more general progress with writing text descriptions for each of the pages, as well as developing a professional-looking style for the page.</li>
		</ul>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><b>Stylings:</b><br></p>
		<p>Heading fonts: Bebas Neue or Neutra Text<br>
		Label fonts: Neutra Text, Arial, or Minecraftia<br>
		Text fonts: Arial</p>
		<p>There are probably only two heading levels needed, standard sizes and weights, different fonts and colors. I'll set up style for all of the built in headings and use them as needed.<br>
		There will be a background image with a background color of #0B0C15. There will be a mostly transparent white overlay over that to separate the middle of the page.<br>
		Headings, emphasized text, and links will be #b6d1ff, the same color as the logo.<br>
		Normal text will be white #ffffff.</p>
