		<p><b>Target Audience:</b><br>
		The target audience is people familiar with the Minecraft modding environment, especially 1.12.2 modding. Ideally people interested in expert-lite quest-based skyblock modpacks.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><b>Design Goals:</b><br>
		I would like the design of the site to be professional-looking but simple, with the goal of the site just being to provide information.</p>
	</div>
	<div>
		<p><b>Limiting Factors:</b><br>
		I will most likely be limited by what is taught in this class and what I have time to do. I want to include a lot of written content for the site, which isn't exactly needed to fulfill requirements in this class, so it is a bit of a time sink for little reason.</p>
