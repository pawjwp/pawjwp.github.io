			<h2>About</h2>


			<p>Celestial Remnants is a <a href="#!quests">quest-based</a> skyblock modpack. When starting your game, you can choose between four different preset <a href="#!maps">maps</a>. <a href="#!quests">Quests</a> will guide you through expanding your island and teach you how to use the resource available to you. There are quests to teach you the basics of how to start out in skyblock, how to use tech mods and magic mods, and quests that require you to get certain items in massive quantities. Completing quests occasionally provides items used in progression, and almost always rewards coins, which can be used to purchase custom loot bags. There are currently 27 <a href="#!bags">loot bag types</a> of different categories and tiers.</p>


			<p>There are also many <a href="#!items">custom resources</a>. All of these resources have Tinker's Construct stats and traits, and can be made into <a href="#!tinkers">Tinker's tools and armor</a>. Among the added materials are new alloys which are made by combining existing alloys. The end result provides extremely powerful resources that have most of the traits and stats of what they are made from. There are also some scientific-style materials available, like aerogel and graphene.</p>


			<p>Some of the most fun I have ever had in Minecraft was playing Agrarian Skies 1 and 2 with my friends 2014-2016. This modpack serves as my way to recreate what made that so special. That does not mean this is at all like Agrarian Skies; this pack recreates the parts of Agrarian Skies that I personally liked the most, but that is likely <i>very</i> different for other people.</p>
